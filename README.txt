HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Intro- Briefing:
You are a special forces operative in a rival foreign country.
Your country's spy satellite was unexpectedly shot down, and has crashed and is burning on a mountain. 
The satellite's hard drive contains very sensitive information and needs to be retreived. The country is aware of this situation and have been unable to send a helicopter to the crash site because of heavy snowfall. The only way up is to scale a vertical glacier. They have sent a few men who lack climbing supplies and may shoot at you from the ground. Once at the top, the USS Poly will send a few helicopters and support aircraft to extract you when the weather clears out. Good Luck. Oh yeah, and the burning satellite and the vibrations of the impact is causing a few boulders to melt and fall, they shouldn't pose too much of a problem....

How To Play:
Try to climb to the top, maneuvering about the falling boulders. You cannot go down, "the only way is up".

- 'W' - up
- 'A' - slide to the left
- 'D' - to the right
-> Right click to take out weapon - you cannot move during this time.
- '1' - handgun
- '2' - AK-47

- 'F' - switch to fullscreen
- 'O' - toggle snow
- 'ESC' - quick quit, so you don't get caught at work...
- 'P' - pause
- 'K' - abort mission

Hints:
- Don't go trigger happy on the boulders, you'll run out of ammunition quickly...
- You'll receive more ammo if you're halfway up
- For the AK-47, shoot in small bursts, the longer you hold the trigger down, the more inaccurate the shots get. Remember, you're firing an AK one-handed!
- Have Fun!

Tweaking:
- Most tweaking can be done in globals.py, however the more adventurous can search all the source files for the comment "config". This comment marks the areas where the values can be tweaked for fun ;)

This game is GPL'd, do whatever you want with it. Just make your derivative works open source :).
